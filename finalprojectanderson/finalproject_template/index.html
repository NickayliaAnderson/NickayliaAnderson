      <p>The 2020 census recorded the population of Syracuse to be at almost 150,000, which according to <a href= https://www.syracuse.com/news/2021/08/first-look-at-2020-census-results-onondaga-countys-population-grew-2-in-a-decade.html> Syracuse News</a>, saw a 2.4% increase over the previous decade. For Syracuse residents, the city can be divided into two places- the North and the South. North Syracuse has roughly 42% of the population while the South has a combined 58%. The crimes in the city further divide the South into two parts, with the Southwest only having 22% of the population but the majority of the homicides from 2020 to 2023. In addition, this part of Syracuse has 23% of the crimes in 2022. How is the data divided? </p>

      <p>The Syracuse Police Department regularly reports the yearly crime documents for the city of Syracuse. The crimes are divided into two parts based on the severity of the crimes that have happened. The <a href=https://www.syr.gov/Departments/Police/Public-Information/COMPSTAT>police website </a> has part 1 crimes which are more severe like homicide, burglary etc. Part 2 crimes which can be considered minor crimes like simple assault and criminal mischief can be found on the <a href=https://data.syr.gov/> Open Data Syracuse Portal </a>. These are important for citizens to know the crimes happening in their areas whether they are directly affected or not. It is also important to learn the crimes that are increasing or decreasing from year to year. For example, the pandemic and certain law changes have impacted the charges of top crimes in previous years.

      <p>Another important fact to track in Syracuse is Quality of Life. Quality of life is how residents are affected by the crimes that happen around them whether indirectly or directly. The crime datasets from year to year document the different crimes that affect this state. This could be in possibly causing disturbances to the communities in and around the location the crime takes place and affecting Syracuse residentsâ€™ safety and peace in their homes and neighborhoods. Across the four year time span of the year 2020 to 2023, the crimes with the most disturbances are Simple Assault and Criminal Mischief. Following right behind are Possession of a Dangerous Weapon and Domestic Violence which is listed under Offenses against Family.</p>

<iframe title="Top 5 Minor Crimes That Affect Quality of Life from 2020-2023" aria-label="Grouped Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-SptbL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SptbL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>


      <p>As said before, there have been many influences on whether these crimes increase and decrease across this time span. For example, as shown in the graph, Possession/Use of Marijuana steadily decreases in 2021 until it reaches zero offenses in 2023. Around this time, marijuana was legalized in the state of New York in March of 2021. Similarly, the decline of Simple Assault and Criminal Mischief charges between 2020 and 2023 could be an impact of the Covid Pandemic on our lives.</p>

      <p>How crimes in Syracuse are charged and labeled is important in understanding the types of crimes more likely to occur in different regions. It is also important to consider age groups in the crimes committed. According to Lieutenant Matthew Malinowski, juvenile crimes are on the rise in the city of Syracuse. In addition, stolen vehicle crimes increased dramatically between 2020 to 2023 because of the fault in the manufacturing of cars such as Hondas. Analyzing the context behind events in specific years in increases and decreases can be a useful tool in recognizing the cause and effect. This can be helpful in creating community initiatives to target these areas.
